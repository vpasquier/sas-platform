### Code pipeline

- PR: Each time a new PR is created for backend and frontend in Preview Env
- Dev Main Branch: Each time a new PR is being merged, the docker image build and push is executed on the ECR with `latest` tag. Dev Env is reloaded with this new image.
- Production Release: Each time we want to promote in production a github action release on demand needs to be run manually with admin approval to build/push the docker image and reload Production Env.
